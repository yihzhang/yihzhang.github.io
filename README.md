## What I have learned through STA 141B

It has been my fortune to be first students taking STA 141B in UCD. The class has definitely been challenging, and at the same time super beneficial to us students. I have not had a Python background before I take this class, since most of the courses offered in UCDÂ are based on R. Python is definitely one of the most popular and widely-used data analysis tool in the modern world, and through this quarter, now I have added Python to my toolbox successfully. I have learned Web scraping, accessing APIs, text processing, plotting geographical data, and accessing database through SQLite through Python. More importantly, this course has stimulated my interest on Python programming, and I will keep learning more about Python on it application on Data Visualization and Machine Learning.

## What I am gonna do in the future

This is my last quarter in UCD, and I am going to graduate school and keep pursuing Statistical knowledge during my graduate's study. I hope to be a data analyst or a data scientist after I graduate, and there is still so much things to learn about Statistics theory and Statistcal programming for me. I will make full use of next few years and try to become a qualified data scientist in the future. STA 141B is definitely a great start for me, and I will definitely keep going!
