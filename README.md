After taking STA 141A last quarter, I realized the importance of computational statistics. The class form is totally different from I have seen in the past three years. I would say it is really amazing to combine Python and statistical analysis together. Assignments were difficult but the professor and TAs were nice to answer all the questions.

The project our gourp work with is my first steps to the application of statistics into real life.
