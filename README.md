<p class="red">Hello STA 141B!</p>

## Intention to take STA 141B

Honestly, my programming background only has the ECS 30 class I took in my sophmore year. It has been a long time I haven't do programming. After taking STA 141A last quarter, I realized the importance of computational statistics. The class form is totally different from I have seen in the past three years. I would say it is really amazing to combine Python and statistical analysis together. Assignments were difficult but the professor and TAs were nice to answer all the questions. I am glad I could take the new STA 141 series class in my last year in UCDavis.


## Interest

I am interested in ultilizing statistical knowledge in the financial situation in the future. I have taken classes like Applied Statistics for Business and Economics. I think it is amazing to use the theory and techniques in the field of statistics into real life questions. The project our gourp work with is my first steps to the application of statistics into real life.

## Final Project

There are thousands of new movies coming out every week. Especially some famous and popular ones are going to be released this month, like the Beauty and Beast, Ghost of Shell. We are curious about the prediction of the rating scores for the upcoming movies on IMDb, a popular online database of information related to films.

Our project is to predict the IMDB rating scores for the upcoming movies. The main goal is to decide which factors significantly contribute to the rating scores of movies and how to predict the scores for the upcoming movies. 

Here is my [Group Final Project](https://github.com/ChrisJZK/STA-141B-Final-Project/blob/master/STA%20141B%20Final%20Project.ipynb).
